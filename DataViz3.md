# Critique by Redesign by Carlyn Petrella

## This project required finding a data vizualization that speaks to something imprtant to me, but that I think can be done better. I chose an article on public perceptions of Climate Change, because I believe it is one of the most pressing problems facing us today. The science behind Climate Change is not in dispute, yet portions of the population still think it is 1) not human induced and 2) not an issue. 

### The original article and vizualization appeared in the Washington Post, and can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/americans-increasingly-see-climate-change-as-a-crisis-poll-shows/2019/09/12/74234db0-cd2a-11e9-87fa-8501a456c003_story.html) The data originated from A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation Poll and can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-kaiser-family-foundation-climate-change-survey-july-9-aug-5-2019/601ed8ff-a7c6-4839-b57e-3f5eaa8ed09f/)


### I was drawn to this article because of the title, _Americans increasingly see climate change as a crisis, poll shows_. Unfortunately, the data presented in the article, although informative, does not call on historical data to show an "increasingly" worried population. On top of that, the vizualization of polling data were bland and wordy. I thought the data could be vizualized in a more striking way, to better grab reader's attention. 

### Before I created the final vizualization seen below, I drew a multitude of sketches, or wireframes, and asked my peers what they thought. The process was incredibly informative. A second (and third) pair of eyes draws attention to my mis-aligned colors and confusing graphics. Because *I* understood what it meant, I took for granted that others would as well. 

### Based on critiques surrounding my wireframe, I: 
### * Revamped the color scheme
### * Re-aranged the data citations
