# Critique by Redesign

## This project involved finding a data vizualization that speaks to something imprtant to me, but that I think can be done better. I chose an article on public perceptions of Climate Change, because I believe it is one of the most pressing problems facing us today. 

The original article and vizualation appeared in the Washington Post, and can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/americans-increasingly-see-climate-change-as-a-crisis-poll-shows/2019/09/12/74234db0-cd2a-11e9-87fa-8501a456c003_story.html)
