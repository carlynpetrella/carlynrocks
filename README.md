## About Me

My name is Carlyn Petrella and I came to Heinz College after a stint in the Peace Corps and five years at the Enviornmental Protection Agency. Both of these experiences demonstrated the importance of sound, fact based policy on the functionality of an organization. I'm excited to learn the theories and techniques behind data vizualization, and use that knowledge to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of new and existing polices. 

My time both in the Peace Corps and with the EPA solidified my desire to shape environmental policy. With a climate crisis unfolding as we sit here, my current focus is on energy efficiencies and greenhouse gas reductions. I worked this summer as an EDF Climate Corps Fellow specifically on those topics, and I plan to use the knowledge I gained to continue that work. 

## What I hope to learn

My goal for this course is to learn how to use data vizualization as both a tool to inform policy creation, as well as for implementation and education. With all of the talk of "fake news" I want to be sure any data vizualizations I use or create speak to truth, and are not in some way manipulative.
