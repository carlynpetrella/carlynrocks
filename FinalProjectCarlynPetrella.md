# The world is on fire and it is only getting worse, but planting a tree can help!
## A data vizualization story about the planet's disappearing tree cover, and what it means for a changing climate. 

For millennia humans been cutting down trees for building material and heating fuel, as well as slashing and burning acres for agriculture and infrastructure.  This vizual story will show the acres of tree cover loss over time, and connect that to our current climate. 

As the storyteller, I want to convey that saving trees isn't just for tree huggers. I want everyone to understand the importance of trees, and be inspired to go plant a tree!

# Part I A Project Proposal 

## The all important data
The majority of data for this project will come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/forests). The website provides copious amounts of data on tree cover by country, as well as reasons for and levels of deforestion. Much of their data comes from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations [The State of the World's Forests](http://www.fao.org/3/I9535EN/i9535en.pdf) report. 

I'll use the data to create a compelling story surrounding deforestation, attempting to show trends and bring urgency to the idea that it must be reversed. 

## Sketches show the beginning of an outline. More sketches to come next week!

# Part II MoodBoards, Wireframes, Storyboards, User Research and More! 

This week started by finding [more data sources!](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/LC) and a MoodBoard.
