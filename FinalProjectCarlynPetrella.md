# The world is on fire and it is only getting worse, but planting a tree can help!
## A data vizualization story about the planet's disappearing tree cover, and what it means for a changing climate. 

For millennia humans been cutting down trees for building material and heating fuel, as well as slashing and burning acres for agriculture and infrastructure.  This vizual story will show the acres of tree cover loss over time, and connect that to our current climate. 

As the storyteller, I want to convey that saving trees isn't just for tree huggers. I want everyone to understand the importance of trees, and be inspired to go plant a tree!

# Part I A Project Proposal 

## The all important data
The majority of data for this project will come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/forests). The website provides copious amounts of data on tree cover by country, as well as reasons for and levels of deforestion. Much of their data comes from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations [The State of the World's Forests](http://www.fao.org/3/I9535EN/i9535en.pdf) report. 

I'll use the data to create a compelling story surrounding deforestation, attempting to show trends and bring urgency to the idea that it must be reversed. 

## Sketches show the beginning of an outline. More sketches to come next week!

# Part II MoodBoards, Wireframes, Storyboards, User Research and More! 

This week started by finding [more data sources](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/LC) from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). A lot of the data from last week was sourced from the FAO, and their raw data retrival system is very user friendly. 

Tree Cover carbon capture calculations were extrapolated from [data](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#pineforests) from the Enviornmental Protection Agency. The USEPA calculated 1 hectare of tree cover sequesters 188 metric tons of carbon. 

After analyzing the data, and starting to put together my storyboard, I've decided a more approprite title for this visual story is 
> **"The World is on fire and it's not looking good, but planting trees can help!"**


### A mood board helped!

## The Target Audience for this visual story is the general public. I want people who may have heard about recent forest fires and slash and burn agriculture to know that this is a long term issue, not just the new hot news. I want people to understand the devastating impact disapearing tree-cover has on our Climate, but also that they can help. People should walk away from the story feeling an urgent need to effect change. I want everyone to feel inspired to go plant a tree!

Because I am targeting the general public, and will be staying in a hotel this weekend, I plan to ask people idling in the lobby if they have a few moments to spare for a graduate student. 

## The all important script! 

Hello, my name is Carlyn Petrella and I’m taking a data visualization class at Carnegie Mellon University. I was wondering if you had about five minutes to help me with a project?

I’d like you to read through a Storyboard I’ve created. While looking over the story, try to keep in mind how it makes you feel, and if it leaves you with more questions than answers, or if it all makes perfect sense! I’ll have a few follow-up questions for you after you have had time to digest the story. 

Questions: Do the Graphic Add to, or Take away from the story?
