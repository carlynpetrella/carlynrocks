# The world is on fire and it is only getting worse, but planting a tree can help!
## A data vizualization story about the planet's disappearing tree cover, and what it means for a changing climate. 

For millennia humans been cutting down trees for building material and heating fuel, as well as slashing and burning acres for agriculture and infrastructure.  This vizual story will show the acres of tree cover loss over time, and connect that to our current climate. 

As the storyteller, I want to convey that saving trees isn't just for tree huggers. I want everyone to understand the importance of trees, and be inspired to go plant a tree!

# Part I A Project Proposal 

## The all important data
The majority of data for this project will come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/forests). The website provides copious amounts of data on tree cover by country, as well as reasons for and levels of deforestion. Much of their data comes from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations [The State of the World's Forests](http://www.fao.org/3/I9535EN/i9535en.pdf) report. 

I'll use the data to create a compelling story surrounding deforestation, attempting to show trends and bring urgency to the idea that it must be reversed. 

## Sketches show the beginning of an outline. More sketches to come next week!

# Part II: MoodBoards, Wireframes, Storyboards, User Research and More! 

This week started by finding [more data sources](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/LC) from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). A lot of the data from last week was sourced from the FAO, and their raw data retrival system is very user friendly. 

Tree Cover carbon capture calculations were extrapolated from [data](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#pineforests) from the Enviornmental Protection Agency. The USEPA calculated 1 hectare of tree cover sequesters 188 metric tons of carbon.

After analyzing the data, and starting to put together my storyboard, I've decided a more approprite title for this visual story is 
> **"The World is on fire and it's not looking good, but planting trees can help!"**


### A mood board helped!
![MoodBoard](https://carlynpetrella.github.io/carlynrocks/MoodBoardjpg.JPG)

## The Target Audience for this visual story is the general public. I want people who may have heard about recent forest fires or recent tree cover loss to know that this is a long standing issue, not just the new hot news. I want people to understand the devastating impact disapearing tree-cover has on our climate, but also know they can help. People should walk away from the story feeling an urgent need to effect change. I want everyone to feel inspired to go plant a tree!

Because I am targeting the general public, and will be staying in a hotel this weekend, I plan to ask people idling in the lobby if they have a few moments to spare for a graduate student. 

## The all important interview script! 

Hello, my name is Carlyn Petrella and I’m taking a data visualization class at Carnegie Mellon University. I was wondering if you had about five minutes to help me with a project?

I’d like you to read through a Storyboard I’ve created. While looking over the story, please keep in mind how it makes you feel. Does it leave you with more questions than answers? Or, does it make perfect sense??

I will have a few follow-up questions after you had had time to digest the story.

Questions: Do the Graphic Add to, or Take away from the story?

Do the graphics make sense? Do you find them confusing or misleading in any way?

Is there something you wish you had seen?

Does any part of this graphic story make you feel a certain way?


### User Research and Findings

I found this exercise very useful. Of the three people interviewed, they had similar comments. I'm breaking comments down with a few specifics from each interview, but I heard the sentiments more than once. 

Interview 1: This user felt my story left them wanting more information on how to help the forests. It is mentioned in the story that Aus/NZ turned their deforestation around, and the user wanted the information on how they did that. Because it was not my intention to provide that type of information, I am going to re-phrase some of that type. 

Interview 2: This user wanted to see more consistency in the graphs. They thought that potentially the graphs should all be of the same "type". All line graph or all bar chart, etc. Beyond that, the first line graph, user had a difficult time interpreting that it was measuring "forest loss". I think this graph would be better suited as an area chart. Additionally, user 2 had a hard time interpreting the last area chart, of Aus/NZ "negative loss". I will have to re-work that chart.  

Interview 3: In general thought story didn't follow through on the introduction. User 3 would have liked to have seen more climate facts. How much CO2 is one degree in global temperature raise. -Again, this wasn't my intended message of the data vizualization. I think I need to rewrite the copy, so it just focuses on tree cover loss and gain over the last 20 years. The climate part is important, and I will keep that information, just phrase the opening better.
