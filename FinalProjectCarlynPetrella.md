# The World is on Fire and it is Only Getting Worse
## A data vizualization story about the planet's disappearing tree cover, and what it means for a changing climate. 

For millennia humans been cutting down trees for building material and heating fuel, as well as slashing and burning acres for agriculture and infrastructure.  This vizual story will show the acres of tree cover loss over time, and connect that to our current climate. 

As the storyteller, I want to convey that saving trees isn't just for tree huggers. I want everyone to understand the importance of trees, and be inspired to go plant a tree!


## The all important data
The majority of data for this project will come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/forests)
